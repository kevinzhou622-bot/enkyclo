  <h1>Future Transportation</h1>
  <p>
    Future transportation examines how artificial intelligence, automation,
    energy systems, and infrastructure redesign will reshape how humans and
    goods move across Earth.
  </p>
</header>

<main>

  <section>
    <h2>System-Level Perspective</h2>
    <p>
      Transportation is increasingly viewed as an integrated system rather than
      a collection of individual vehicles. Advances in sensing, communication,
      and computation allow transportation networks to operate as coordinated,
      adaptive systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      This shift emphasizes optimization across traffic flow, energy usage,
      safety, and environmental impact rather than isolated vehicle performance.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Autonomous Mobility</h2>
    <p>
      Autonomous transportation relies on artificial intelligence to perceive
      environments, predict behavior, and make real-time decisions. These systems
      integrate computer vision, probabilistic modeling, and reinforcement learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The long-term goal is not simply driverless vehicles, but transportation
      networks where autonomy enables coordination between vehicles, infrastructure,
      and urban planning.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Energy and Sustainability Constraints</h2>
    <p>
      Future transportation systems must operate under strict energy and climate
      constraints. Electrification, alternative fuels, and energy-efficient routing
      are critical components.
    </p>
    <p>
      AI-driven optimization plays a central role in managing charging networks,
      grid interaction, and lifecycle efficiency of transportation systems.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Urban and Societal Impact</h2>
    <p>
      Transportation shapes urban form, economic opportunity, and social equity.
      Intelligent transportation systems can reduce congestion and emissions, but
      may also introduce new risks related to surveillance, access, and control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Policy, ethics, and governance will influence whether future transportation
      systems amplify inequality or increase accessibility.
    </p>
  </section>

  <div class="note">
    Enkyclo treats future transportation as a cyber-physical system where
    artificial intelligence mediates between infrastructure, energy, and human behavior.
