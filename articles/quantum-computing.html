  <h1>Quantum Computing</h1>
  <p>
    Quantum computing is a computational paradigm that exploits quantum mechanical
    phenomena to perform information processing beyond the capabilities of classical computers.
  </p>
</header>

<main>

  <section>
    <h2>Conceptual Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Quantum computing is based on the manipulation of quantum states to encode and transform
      information. Unlike classical computers, which operate on binary bits, quantum computers
      use quantum bits, or qubits, that can exist in superpositions of states.
    </p>
    <p>
      This allows quantum systems to represent and process information in high-dimensional
      state spaces, enabling computational strategies that have no direct classical analogue.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Quantum Information Representation</h2>
    <p>
      A qubit is a physical system that can be prepared in a coherent superposition of basis
      states. Measurement collapses this superposition probabilistically, revealing classical
      outcomes while destroying quantum coherence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entanglement enables correlations between qubits that cannot be described by classical
      probability theory. These correlations form the basis of quantum advantage in certain
      computational tasks.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Computational Models</h2>
    <p>
      The dominant model of quantum computation is the quantum circuit model, in which
      unitary transformations are applied to qubits via quantum gates. Computation proceeds
      through controlled evolution followed by measurement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternative models include quantum annealing and measurement-based quantum computing,
      each optimized for different classes of problems and physical implementations.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Error, Noise, and Decoherence</h2>
    <p>
      Quantum systems are highly sensitive to environmental interference. Decoherence causes
      quantum states to lose phase information, degrading computational accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quantum error correction schemes encode logical qubits across multiple physical qubits,
      allowing error detection without direct measurement of quantum information.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Current Capabilities and Limits</h2>
    <p>
      Present-day quantum computers operate in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)
      regime. They can demonstrate quantum effects but lack sufficient error correction for
      large-scale, fault-tolerant computation.
    </p>
    <p>
      While quantum advantage has been demonstrated for specialized tasks, practical
      applications remain limited by hardware scalability and noise control.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Future Trajectories</h2>
    <p>
      Long-term quantum computing research focuses on fault-tolerant architectures,
      scalable qubit fabrication, and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Advances in materials science, cryogenics, and control systems are expected to
      determine the feasibility of large-scale quantum computation.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Relationship to Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <p>
      Quantum computing may augment artificial intelligence by accelerating optimization,
      sampling, and learning tasks. Conversely, AI techniques are increasingly used to
      control and optimize quantum systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      This bidirectional relationship positions quantum computing as both a tool for
      and an object of artificial intelligence research.
    </p>

    significance lies not in immediate applications, but in its potential to redefine
    the limits of computation itself.
