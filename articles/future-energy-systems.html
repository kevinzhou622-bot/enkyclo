  <h1>Future Energy Systems</h1>
  <p>
    Future energy systems examine how electricity generation, storage,
    distribution, and consumption will evolve under technological,
    environmental, and computational constraints.
  </p>
</header>

<main>

  <section>
    <h2>System-Level Perspective</h2>
    <p>
      Energy systems are transitioning from centralized, fuel-based
      infrastructures toward distributed, data-driven networks.
      This transition is driven by climate constraints, electrification,
      and the integration of renewable energy sources.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather than optimizing individual power plants, future energy systems
      are designed as adaptive networks that balance supply, demand,
      storage, and transmission in real time.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Generation Technologies</h2>
    <p>
      Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind form the backbone
      of future energy generation. Their variability introduces
      complexity that requires sophisticated forecasting and control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Advanced nuclear concepts, fusion research, and next-generation
      geothermal systems are also explored as potential sources of
      high-density, low-carbon energy.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Energy Storage and Flexibility</h2>
    <p>
      Large-scale energy storage is critical for balancing intermittent
      generation. Technologies include electrochemical batteries,
      thermal storage, mechanical systems, and emerging solid-state
      approaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flexibility is increasingly provided not only by storage, but also
      by demand-side response, where consumption patterns adapt dynamically
      to grid conditions.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Artificial Intelligence in Energy Systems</h2>
    <p>
      Artificial intelligence plays a central role in future energy systems
      by enabling forecasting, optimization, and autonomous control.
      Machine learning models predict demand, renewable output,
      and equipment degradation.
    </p>
    <p>
      AI-driven control systems coordinate millions of distributed assets,
      including electric vehicles, smart appliances, and microgrids,
      forming a cyber-physical energy network.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Infrastructure and Grid Evolution</h2>
    <p>
      Electrical grids are evolving into intelligent platforms capable
      of bidirectional power flow and decentralized decision-making.
      Digital sensing and communication are becoming as important
      as physical transmission infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grid resilience against extreme weather, cyber threats, and
      cascading failures is a primary design constraint for future systems.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Long-Term Constraints and Tradeoffs</h2>
    <p>
      Future energy systems must operate within physical limits related
      to materials, land use, and thermodynamics. Social and political
      factors further shape deployment and governance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The challenge is not solely technological, but systemic: aligning
      incentives, regulation, and innovation to enable sustainable
      energy transitions at global scale.
    </p>
