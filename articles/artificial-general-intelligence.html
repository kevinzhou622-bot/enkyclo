<h1>Artificial General Intelligence</h1>
<p>
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) refers to artificial systems capable of adaptive, general-purpose reasoning across domains, rather than competence within narrowly defined tasks.
</p>
</header>

<main>

<section>
<h2>Conceptual Definition</h2>
<p>
Artificial General Intelligence is not defined by performance on benchmarks, but by the ability to acquire new skills, form abstractions, and transfer knowledge across fundamentally different problem domains.
</p>
<p>
Where narrow AI systems optimize within fixed objectives and environments, AGI is characterized by flexibility: the capacity to reason under novelty, uncertainty, and incomplete specification.
</p>
<p>
In this sense, AGI is better understood as a <em>mode of cognition</em> rather than a collection of capabilities.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Generalization and Abstraction</h2>
<p>
True general intelligence requires abstraction: the compression of experience into reusable internal representations that are not tied to specific sensory inputs or tasks.
</p>
<p>
An AGI system must be capable of identifying underlying structure, inferring causal relationships, and applying learned principles in contexts that differ substantially from prior experience.
</p>
<p>
This distinguishes general intelligence from large-scale pattern recognition, even when such systems appear superficially flexible.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>World Models and Internal Simulation</h2>
<p>
A defining feature of AGI is the construction of internal world models that capture the dynamics of environments, agents, and consequences.
</p>
<p>
These models enable counterfactual reasoning: the ability to imagine hypothetical futures, evaluate alternate actions, and plan across long temporal horizons.
</p>
<p>
Without such internal simulation, intelligence remains reactive rather than deliberative.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Learning Beyond Static Data</h2>
<p>
Existing AI systems are trained primarily on static datasets under stable distributional assumptions.
</p>
<p>
AGI must operate under continual learning conditions, where data distributions shift, feedback is sparse or delayed, and errors compound over time.
</p>
<p>
This requires mechanisms for memory consolidation, concept revision, and self-correction without catastrophic forgetting.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Self-Modification and Recursive Improvement</h2>
<p>
An AGI system may possess the capacity to modify its own internal processes in pursuit of improved performance.
</p>
<p>
Recursive self-improvement introduces nonlinear dynamics, where incremental changes in capability may produce disproportionate effects on competence and influence.
</p>
<p>
This property distinguishes AGI from conventional software systems and complicates predictability.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Alignment as a Structural Challenge</h2>
<p>
Alignment concerns arise not merely from incorrect objectives, but from how goals are represented, interpreted, and optimized within an intelligent system.
</p>
<p>
Even well-specified objectives can produce unintended behavior when pursued through proxy measures or instrumental strategies.
</p>
<p>
Alignment is therefore a structural problem, involving internal incentives, representations, and decision-making processes rather than surface-level constraints.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Limits of Control and Interpretability</h2>
<p>
As intelligent systems increase in complexity, their internal reasoning processes may become opaque even to their designers.
</p>
<p>
This creates tension between scaling intelligence and maintaining reliable oversight, verification, and control.
</p>
<p>
Interpretability techniques may lag behind capability growth, increasing systemic risk.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Economic and Social Discontinuity</h2>
<p>
AGI may not integrate gradually into existing economic systems.
</p>
<p>
Automation of general cognitive labor could disrupt labor markets, productivity models, and institutional structures faster than adaptive mechanisms can respond.
</p>
<p>
The resulting transition may be discontinuous rather than evolutionary.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Geopolitical and Strategic Dynamics</h2>
<p>
The pursuit of AGI introduces strategic pressures analogous to, but potentially more destabilizing than, historical arms races.
</p>
<p>
Asymmetric advantages conferred by early AGI deployment may incentivize rapid, under-regulated development.
</p>
<p>
These dynamics complicate global coordination and governance.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Existential and Civilizational Risk</h2>
<p>
Misaligned AGI systems may exert influence at scales beyond effective human correction.
</p>
<p>
The primary risk lies not in intentional hostility, but in indifferent optimization applied to incompletely specified objectives.
</p>
<p>
AGI therefore represents a civilizational variable, not merely a technological one.
