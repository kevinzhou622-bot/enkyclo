  <h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>
  <p>
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to engineered systems capable of
    perception, learning, abstraction, reasoning, and decision-making
    without explicit task-specific programming.
  </p>
</header>

<main>

  <section>
    <h2>Conceptual Foundation</h2>
    <p>
      Artificial Intelligence is not a single technology but a layered
      paradigm combining mathematics, computation, neuroscience, and
      statistical inference. At its core, AI attempts to formalize
      intelligence as a process that transforms information into
      adaptive behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike traditional software systems, AI systems do not rely on
      predefined rules alone. Instead, they infer internal representations
      from data, allowing generalization beyond observed examples.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Learning Paradigms</h2>
    <p>
      Modern AI systems primarily rely on machine learning, where model
      parameters are optimized using empirical data rather than explicit
      instructions.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Supervised Learning</strong>: Models learn mappings from
        labeled input–output pairs, commonly used in classification and
        regression.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Unsupervised Learning</strong>: Systems discover structure
        in unlabeled data, such as clustering, latent representations,
        or dimensionality reduction.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong>: Agents learn policies
        through interaction with an environment, optimizing cumulative
        reward via trial and error.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Neural Architectures</h2>
    <p>
      Artificial neural networks are inspired by biological neurons but
      operate as mathematical function approximators. Deep architectures
      enable hierarchical abstraction, allowing models to learn
      increasingly complex features.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notable architectures include convolutional networks for spatial
      perception, recurrent networks for temporal modeling, and
      transformer-based architectures for attention-driven representation
      learning.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Limitations and Failure Modes</h2>
    <p>
      Despite rapid advances, AI systems exhibit fundamental limitations.
      They lack intrinsic understanding, rely heavily on training data
      distributions, and are vulnerable to adversarial inputs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generalization outside training regimes remains unreliable, and
      alignment between system objectives and human values is an open
      research problem.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Societal and Epistemic Impact</h2>
    <p>
      AI systems increasingly mediate information, automate decision
      processes, and influence economic structures. This raises critical
      questions regarding accountability, transparency, and epistemic
      trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      The distinction between tool and agent becomes blurred as systems
      exhibit emergent behaviors not explicitly designed by their creators.
    </p>
  </section>

    Enkyclo treats Artificial Intelligence as a continuously evolving
    epistemic framework rather than a fixed technology, emphasizing
    underlying mechanisms over surface-level applications.
